# automation-work-scripts

These programs automate tasks for my job. The tasks are things such as sending and formatting emails with data,
checking dropbox folders for submissions (using DropBox API), and creating individualized service report pdf files. The programs use spreadsheets (as
pandas dataframes) to get data. Data includes contact info, links, Facebook ad result metrics, dates, etc.
